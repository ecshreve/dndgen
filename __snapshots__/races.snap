   "alignmentDesc": "Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.",
   "indx": "dwarf",
   "languageDesc": "You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.",

   "indx": "halfling",
   "languageDesc": "You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong.

   "alignmentDesc": "Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors.

   "alignmentDesc": "Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage.
